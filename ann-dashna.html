      <div class="member-message">
        <p>
          <strong>Ann-Dashna</strong> — you are genuinely one of the most fun, goofy, and loving people to be around.
          You have this silly, bright energy that fills a room without you even trying, and somehow you’re always
          finding a way to make people laugh — even when you’re just being yourself. But what I love most is how
          warm you are. You’re a true lover at heart — the kind of person who checks on everyone, takes care of
          the people around you, and gives love in ways that feel effortless and real.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Watching you grow has been amazing, because you’re learning more and more about what you love — the
          different things you enjoy, the hobbies you try, and the parts of you that keep unfolding. Whether it’s
          family moments, new experiences, or the things you’re passionate about, you’re becoming your own person
          in the best way — and I’m proud of you every step of the way.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          And even though you’re growing up, just know I’ll always be your older brother first — always here for you,
          always in your corner, always ready to support you, protect you, and remind you how loved you are. No matter
          what changes, that part will never change.
        </p>
