      <div class="member-message">
        <p>
          <strong>Anne-Marie</strong> — you are one of the wisest, most loving, and most important people in our family.
          You love harder than anyone I know, and even now, you continue to provide for us, care for us, and guide us
          in ways that shape who we are every single day. Your presence alone brings comfort, stability, and peace.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are a giver at heart. No matter the situation, you’re always thinking about someone else — showing up
          with a gift, a meal, advice, or simply your time. You’ve taught us so much without ever asking for recognition:
          how to cook, how to iron clothes properly, how to do laundry, how to carry yourself with dignity, and how to
          take care of others with intention and love.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are a teacher, a nurturer, and a caregiver in every sense of the word. Strong without being harsh.
          Wise without being loud. Your lessons live in us — in the way we move through the world, the way we show love,
          and the way we look out for one another. Our family is better, stronger, and fuller because of you.
        </p>
