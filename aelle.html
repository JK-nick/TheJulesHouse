      <!-- MEMBER MESSAGE -->
      <div class="member-message">
        <p>
          <strong>You</strong> — loving mother, event thrower, woman of God, caretaker, supporter.
          Even all of those titles together still don’t fully capture who you are.
          You are the kind of person who naturally becomes the center of a family —
          not by demanding it, but by giving so much of yourself that everyone feels
          held, seen, and supported.
        </p>

        <p>
          You show up in every way that matters. Loudly when someone needs encouragement,
          quietly when someone needs comfort. You love with your whole heart, give without
          keeping score, and somehow manage to carry everyone else while still making space
          for joy, laughter, and celebration. You bring people together not just for events,
          but for moments that turn into memories.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are hardworking, intelligent, and endlessly giving. You take on burdens that
          aren’t even yours, solve problems before anyone asks, and still find a way to smile
          through it all. Your kindness isn’t performative — it’s consistent, steady, and
          deeply real. You make people feel safe simply by being present.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your faith grounds you, your love leads you, and your strength carries all of us.
          Our family exists the way it does because of you — because of your sacrifices,
          your prayers, and your unwavering belief in the people you love. You are the glue,
          the heartbeat, and the reason so many of us are who we are today.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Happy Birthday.</em> You are loved more than words can ever fully explain,
          and appreciated more deeply than you’ll ever know.
        </p>
      </div>
