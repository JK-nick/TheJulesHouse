        <p><strong>Hi Mama,</strong></p>
      
        <p>
          I think you might be seeing this on your birthday… or maybe on Christmas.
          I spent a long time thinking about what to give you this year, and I wanted
          it to be something truly special — something personal, creative, and lasting.
          I wanted to give you a gift that shows how deeply I love you, but also something
          you could make your own in whatever way you want.
        </p>
      
        <p><em>So I made this.</em></p>
      
        <p>
          This is our family website — a small digital marker of who we are and the people
          who make our family what it is. It’s a place to hold memories, laughter, and love,
          and something we can keep growing together. Over time, we can add pages, add people,
          and add more stories as our family continues to grow. But for its first version,
          I just wanted it to be us.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I’ll admit… I kind of cheated and made this a gift for everyone, too — but it’s
          primarily for you. Because our family starts with you, and so much of who we are
          exists because of the love you’ve given us.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I hope you like it, and I hope it makes you smile.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          <strong>Happy Birthday and Merry Christmas.</strong><br>
          I love you more than words can say.
        </p>
