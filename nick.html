          <p>
            <strong>Nick</strong> — being the oldest isn’t just a title… it’s a role you’ve carried with heart.
            You’ve always been the first one to step up, the one who gets serious when it matters,
            and the one who tries to make sure everyone around you is good — even when you’re juggling your own
            pressure and plans. You’ve got that natural “leader” energy, but it’s never loud for attention —
            it’s more like protection, responsibility, and love.
          </p>

          <p>
            You’ve grown into somebody who’s determined and driven, but still playful, still real, still you.
            Whether it’s pushing yourself in new places, leveling up in life, or making big moves that most people
            would be scared to even try — you always find a way to keep going. And the best part is you don’t do
            it just for yourself… you do it with the mindset of building something bigger for the people you love.
          </p>

          <p>
            And honestly? I love watching you figure it out in real time — trying things, learning fast, switching lanes,
            leveling up, and slowly building a life that actually fits you (not just what people expect from “the oldest”).
            You’re still becoming, still exploring, still making your place in the world — and you do it with a mix of
            confidence and curiosity that makes the whole journey look exciting. It’s not “perfect,” it’s not “finished,”
            it’s just real… and that’s what makes it you.
